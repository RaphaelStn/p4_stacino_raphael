Dear God, they\'ll be killed on our doorstep! And there\'s no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>\r\n<p>Eeeee! Now say \"nuclear wessels\"! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.&nbsp;<strong>I don\'t want to be rescued.</strong>&nbsp;<em>I don\'t know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up!</em>&nbsp;Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</p>\r\n<p>Can I use the gun? No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Soon enough. Hey, what kinda party is this? There\'s no booze and only one hooker. I\'m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn\'t alive to see this day.</p>\r\n<p>There\'s no part of that sentence I didn\'t like! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? They\'re like sex, except I\'m having them! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn\'t rock.</p>\r\n<p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>\r\n<p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Bender, hurry! This fuel\'s expensive! Also, we\'re dying! You wouldn\'t. Ask anyway! Kids don\'t turn rotten just from watching TV.</p>\r\n<p>Good news, everyone! There\'s a report on TV with some very bad news! Good man. Nixon\'s pro-war and pro-family. Isn\'t it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Hey, whatcha watching? File not found.</p>\r\n<p>Bender, being God isn\'t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Well, let\'s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>\r\n<p>I haven\'t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. That\'s right, baby. I ain\'t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! I don\'t want to be rescued.</p>\r\n<p>Say it in Russian! And then the battle\'s not so bad? You\'re going to do his laundry? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Leela, Bender, we\'re going grave robbing. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There\'s only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>\r\n<p>Ah, the \'Breakfast Club\' soundtrack! I can\'t wait til I\'m old enough to feel ways about stuff! Professor, make a woman out of me. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You\'d think it would be something you\'d have to freebase.</p>\r\n<p>They\'re like sex, except I\'m having them! Belligerent and numerous. I suppose I could part with \'one\' and still be feared&hellip; Why would a robot need to drink? Tell them I hate them. No argument here.</p>\r\n<p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! \'It is!\' My precious torso! It\'s a T. It goes \"tuh\". I can explain. It\'s very valuable. Ummm&hellip;to eBay? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>\r\n<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. Actually, that\'s still true. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Oh, you\'re a dollar naughtier than most. Daylight and everything.</p>\r\n<p>Hello Morbo, how\'s the family? Who am I making this out to? She also liked to shut up! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I\'m still single? It\'s \'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>\r\n<p>You mean while I\'m sleeping in it? Can I use the gun? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>\r\n<p>Too much work. Let\'s burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Hey, what kinda party is this? There\'s no booze and only one hooker. Negative, bossy meat creature!</p>\r\n<p>I could if you hadn\'t turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Yeah, and if you were the pope they\'d be all, \"Straighten your pope hat.\" And \"Put on your good vestments.\"</p>\r\n<p>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
