Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I\'m still single? It\'s \'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>\r\n<p>There, now he\'s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Bender, being God isn\'t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>\r\n<p>Is that a cooking show? Who am I making this out to? And remember, don\'t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don\'t not do it!</p>\r\n<p>It\'s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Kids don\'t turn rotten just from watching TV. Well, then good news! It\'s a suppository. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>\r\n<p>A sexy mistake. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year\'s costume? You know, I was God once. You know, I was God once. But I\'ve never been to the moon!</p>\r\n<p>Why yes!

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of \'will\'?</p>\r\n<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Who\'s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that\'s it.</p>\r\n<p>Why would a robot need to drink? I don\'t know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>\r\n<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. A sexy mistake. Bender, this is Fry\'s decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it\'s time for us to interfere in his life.</p>\r\n<p>Ah, computer dating. It\'s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase \"upside your head.\" If rubbin\' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don\'t wanna be right.

Soothe us with sweet lies. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. It\'s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I\'m still single? It\'s \'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>\r\n<p>Bite my shiny metal ass. We\'re also Santa Claus! Okay, it\'s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can\'t hold the charge and the reception isn\'t very&hellip; We can\'t compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>\r\n<p>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Yeah, lots of people did. I had more, but you go ahead. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>\r\n<p>I didn\'t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You\'ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you\'re partying with Slurms McKenzie! Hey, whatcha watching?</p>\r\n<p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. For the last time, I don\'t like lilacs! Your \'first\' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I can explain. It\'s very valuable. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>\r\n<p>And yet you haven\'t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? What\'s with you kids? Every other day it\'s food, food, food. Alright, I\'ll get you some stupid food. It may comfort you to know that Fry\'s death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n</article>');
